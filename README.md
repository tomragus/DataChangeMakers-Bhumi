# DataChangeMakers - Bhumi Volunteering Initiative

Bhumi is one of India's largest non-profit organizations, focusing on providing education to underprivileged children and promoting civic volunteering to tackle social issues. In 2024-2025, Bhumi's volunteering initiative held over 900 events all across India, contributing to causes including education, environment, animal welfare, and community development. In partnership with DataChangeMakers, Bhumi has tasked data analysts with creating a dashboard for this initiative that showcases the work of the volunteers in a way that is both comprehensive and inspiring.Â For my dashboard, my focus was on interactivity - play around with with the timeline and cause selector, and watch how the map and event explorer update, displaying each event and outcomes!

I have as of yet not figured out how to embed Tableau dashboards into GitHub in a straightforward way, so for now, check it out on Tableau Public ðŸ‘‰ [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tom.ragus/viz/BhumiVolunteeringInitiative/BhumiDashboard#1)
